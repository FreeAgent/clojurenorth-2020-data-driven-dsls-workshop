# Clojure Katas - Data Driven APIs (ClojureNorth 2020 Workshop)

In recent years, there’s been a wave of new Clojure libraries written with “data driven” APIs. Be it routing, database-querying, or composing systems - problems that were once solved with string-, function- or macro-based DSLs are now being re-solved in a new “style” that’s somewhat unique to Clojure. What does it mean to be ‘data driven’? Is it just a fad? Is it only for libraries?

In the first hour, we will do a brief explanation of data-driven APIs, and then participants will be tasked with designing data-driven APIs for some prepared problems. In the second hour, we will review and discuss the various solutions.

(Since we’re focusing on design rather than implementation, this workshop should be accessible to Clojurians of all levels).

1st Hour:
 - introduce “data-driven” apis
 - introduce design problems
 - participants work on design problems

2nd Hour:
 - participants submit their solutions for critique
 - review and discussion of solutions


## Your Design Task

1. Choose one of the problem domains from [this list](./problem-domains.md).

   We recommend choosing a problem domain that you are at least somewhat familiar with (to better understand how your syntax might be used in practice).

   If you've thought of other problem domain that you'd like to design a data-driven API for, go ahead!


2. Design a data-driven DSL for that problem domain.

   give some examples of how you would use it.

   see [the template](./template.md)

   The task is *not* to implement the system, it is just to design the data-driven API.

   You do not have to implement the entire language, just use the existing language as inspiration.

3. Reflect using [these questions](./evaluating-notations.md)

4. After you're done with your design(s), if you'd like to have them potentially discussed in Part 2 of the workshop, add a link to [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F7TGID104-ayVhOT47RV3fCLHpvAaeOGZScIKdvG9-8/edit?usp=sharing).
