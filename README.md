# Clojure Katas - Data Driven APIs (ClojureNorth 2020 Workshop)

In recent years, there’s been a wave of new Clojure libraries written with “data driven” APIs. Be it routing, database-querying, or composing systems - problems that were once solved with string-, function- or macro-based DSLs are now being re-solved in a new “style” that’s somewhat unique to Clojure. What does it mean to be ‘data driven’? Is it just a fad? Is it only for libraries?

In the first hour, we will do a brief explanation of data-driven APIs, and then participants will be tasked with designing data-driven APIs for some prepared problems. In the second hour, we will review and discuss the various solutions.

(Since we’re focusing on design rather than implementation, this workshop should be accessible to Clojurians of all levels).

1st Hour:
 - introduce “data-driven” apis
 - introduce design problems
 - participants work on design problems

2nd Hour:
 - participants submit their solutions for critique
 - review and discussion of solutions

## The Katas

 1. [Designing a data-driven DSL based on an existing declarative DSL](/docs/data-driven-by-porting.md)

 2. [Designing a data-driven DSL from scratch](/docs/data-driven-from-scratch.md)


After you're done with any of the exercises, if you'd like to have them potentially discussed in Part 2 of the workshop, add a link to [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F7TGID104-ayVhOT47RV3fCLHpvAaeOGZScIKdvG9-8/edit?usp=sharing).
