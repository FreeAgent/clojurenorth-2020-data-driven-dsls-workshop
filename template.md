# [ libname ]

[ Libname ] is a Clojure(script) library for [ some task ].

[ Some extra information if you'd like. ]

<sup>(Protip: If you're having a hard time coming up with a name for your design, just do what Metosin does: pick the most matter-of-fact word to describe your library, but in Finnish instead of English).</sup>

## Quick Start

```clojure
  ;; one or more examples of how someone would use libname
  ;; inputs, outputs, workflow
  ;; is it just one function or more?
```







## Limitations / Future Work

[ what would you like to have added or changed in your design? ]
[ any particular challenges? ]
[ was a data-driven approach suitable for this problem? ]
[ any of the reflection questions particularly relevant? ]
