### ERD Diagrams

Like DOT, but, just for ERD diagrams. (A more limited domain might allow for a simpler syntax)


### Argument Parsing

“data driven ‘spec’ for what a commandline can take in”,
    What would the extracted data look like?

`./program -l -p 8080 -d /usr/logs -g a,b,c,d,e`


### ACL on Data Structures

Representing ACL rules on certain fields (to then be used to ‘filter’ data structures)


### Finite-State Machines

### End-to-End Testing

declerative format to run E2E tests

can do so w/ full support of language
but, since the domain is pretty limited (visit url, click button 'x', check for value 'y', etc.), could a data-driven syntax work?

### Mathematical Notation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX#Mathematical_example

for generating, manipulating and then..
      … converting for use in latex
              … converting for use in a symbolic math system (Maple, Mathematica)


### System Dynamics

 representing System Dynamics (stocks and flows)

### Chemical Formulas

Representing chemical formulas, so they can be balanced

### Chemical Structural Formulas

Representing the molecular structure of a complex compoound, for the purpose of then generating a diagram (one or more of: skeletal diagram, lewis dot diagram, etc.)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_formula

(perhaps similar to DOT, but, because it's an even more limited domain, you can make the language less general)
